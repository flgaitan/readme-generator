# <README.md Generator>

## Description

The motivation for this project was to successfully be able to navigate through node and be able to communicate effectively with the server.

This project was built as a way to put the newly learned skills to the test and finish the challenge (with given code) successfully as our introduction to the node module.

This particular challenge is helping identify whether or not we are downloading packages successfully and also helping identify future hiccups down the line. For example, my packages were downloaded twice which lead me to create a new repo instead of trying to fix a repository that was already having trouble talking to the server.

In this project I learned how to attach all my information to my file using key pieces of information we learned in class like npm init and npm i inquirer to install the packages and versions needed, I also used functions and arrow functions to run my code.
